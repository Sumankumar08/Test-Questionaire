Test-Questionaire - A React Project

A front end website made using React libraries for a sample quiz app.

Welcome page: Landing-page1 Landing-page2

Landing page with the option to choose between tests.

Sample test page : Test-page1 Test-page2

This page consists of a sample test that only allows the user to go to the next question once the previous question is answered. Once all the questions have been answered the user gets the option to submit their answers.

Final submission page: Submission-page2

Once the test is submitted the user gets the option to retake their test if needed. Thereâ€™s also a chat option that does not have any current functionality but can also be added.

Improvements can be done for the final submission page that can include the scores and display the result.
